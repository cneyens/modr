# modr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`modr` contains functions to read [MODFLOW 6](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model) output into R and to create different objects from that output, such as [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) which can be used for plotting or spatial objects using the [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package which can be exported.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `modr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cneyens/modr")
```

## Example

Coming soon.
